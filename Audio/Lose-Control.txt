<p data-time="43">I lose control<br>When you're not here with me, mm‑hmm<br>Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby<br>You make a mess of me</p>

<p data-time="55">Problematic, the problem is I want your body like every day<br>You don't understand the static I’m messin' bad with, can’t stay away</p>
<p data-time="65">So I keep on comin' back, you keep on comin' back<br>Pullin’ me further off the track, no, I just can’t help myself</p>
